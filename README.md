# Scrapy_Drones

## This project writing about how to crawl data from website: [Drones](https://www.jessops.com/drones)

I use `Scrapy Framework` to extract data products from websites:
- Name
- Price

You can download this project to your computer using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/minhson1411/scrapy-drones.git
```
Open terminal and navigate to the directory `scrapy` -> `drones` and type the command:
```
scrapy crawl dronesspider 
```
If you want to convert to `CSV` file, you can the command
```
scrapy crawl dronesspider -o drones.csv
```

That's what I want to share with you through this repo.

Thank's Bro !!!
